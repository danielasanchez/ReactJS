# Update!

A new repository was created that uses **Vite** to create projects and only uses functional components: [ReactJS2025](https://github.com/danielasanchez/ReactJS2025).






### Hi, welcome to my React repository

In this repository, some examples using React JS are shown.

To use these projects, you need to install **node js**, and in each project use ***npm install*** to create **node_modules** folder.
